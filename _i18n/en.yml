  tagline: Artificial Intelligence for social control of public administration
  about: An open project that uses data science - the same technologies used by giants like Google, Facebook and Netflix - for the purpose of monitoring public spending and sharing information in a way accessible to anyone.
  rosie: "Serenata has created <a href='https://twitter.com/RosieDaSerenata' class='purple'>Rosie</a>: an artificial intelligence capable of analyzing the expenses reimbursed by the Parliamentary Activity Charge (CEAP), of congresspeople, made in the exercise of their function, identifying suspicions and encouraging the population to question them."
  jarbas: "In order for the population to be able to understand the information generated by Rosie, we have created <a href='https://jarbas.serenata.ai/' class='purple'>Jarbas</a>. In this website users can navigate the expenses and find out more about each suspicion, in a simple and uncomplicated way. That's where work begins to validate a suspicion raised by Rosie."

  title: Operation Serenata de Amor
  who_contributed: Contributors
  paragraph_one: We are a technology project that uses artificial intelligence to audit public accounts and support social control. The idea came from the data scientist <a href="https://twitter.com/irio"> Irio Musskopf </a>, as a way to actively participate in the democratic process, overseeing public spending. When sharing the idea with friends, it didn't take long for the project be spread all over the country, with a team of 10 people and more than 600 volunteers willing to do it.
  paragraph_two: And then, the Operation Serenade of Love has started, focused on monitoring, with the help of technology, the reimbursements made by the Parliamentary Activity Charge (CEAP) - money that costs food, transportation, lodging and even expenses with culture and TV signatures of parliamentarians.
  paragraph_three: On September 7, 2016, our first collective financing campaign was alive, which managed to raise approximately R$ 80,000, 30% more than the amount requested, enough to finance the operations of the team for the first 90 days.
  paragraph_four: Since then, our work, based on information and transparency, has gained space in events and lectures around the world, and has been prominent in the media, being covered by more than 90 journalistics vehicles, including the largest in the country, such as <a href="https://globoplay.globo.com/v/6267741/programa/" target="_blank">Fantastico</a>, <a href="https://globoplay.globo.com/v/5608268/" target="_blank">Jornal Nacional</a> and <a href="http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2017/01/1852180-jovens-criam-robo-que-monitora-despesas-de-deputados-federais.shtml" target="_blank">Folha de S. Paulo</a>, and a great relevance in the scenario of social control in Brazil.

  question_one: 1. What does the name Serenata de Amor mean?
  answer_one: 'There three reasons: <br>1 - We are  directly inspired by the famous Toblerone Affair – a famous case in which a politician in Sweden resigned after being caught with a simple Toblerone in the invoice of her corporate card. We want to do this: find corruption at small scale, but in large volume. <br>2 - It seems to be the a nonsense operation name typical of the Brazilian Federal Police, and this is very cool. <br>3 - It literally means love serenade — so this is our love serenade to Brazil.'
  question_two: 2. Who is responsible for the project?
  answer_two: 'We are a <a href="https://twitter.com/cuducos/status/819520770716090368" target="_blank"> group </a> of technology enthusiasts. The project started as an initiative of the data scientist <a href="twitter.com/irio" target="_blank">Irio Musskopf</a>, grew and today has taken on a life of its own, with a team of 10 professionals. Every code is open, and now we have hundreds of volunteers: collaborators from all over the world, including journalists and researchers.'
  question_three: 3. Where are you?
  answer_three: Our team is spread across different cities and countries. We use the benefits of technology to get meetings, discuss the project, and continue the work remotely, without needing a physical space.
  question_four: 4. What is open source?
  answer_four: Open source is an English term used for open source code distribution where everyone interested in contributing to the evolution of the project can freely add their ideas without paying for license or intellectual property. In other words, Serenata is free for anyone to access.
  question_five: 5. Which data we use?
  answer_five: We use public data - whether data made public by the Access Information Law (LAI), or private data made publicly available by companies such as Google, Foursquare, Yelp etc. In the public sphere we obtain data from the Chamber of Deputies, Federal Revenue, Transparency Portal, data.gov.br etc.
  question_six: 6. What is CEAP - Quota for the Exercise of Parliamentary Activity?
  answer_six: The <a href="http://www.camara.gov.br/cota-parlamentar" target="_blank">Quota for Exercise of Parliamentary Activity</a> (CEAP in the acronym in Portuguese) is a monthly amount of up to R$ 45 thousand that each Chamber of Deputies Member is entitled to reimbursement for expenses that are not fit for public bidding. A lunch or taxi payment, for example.
  question_seven: 7. What is the difference between an irregularity and a suspicion?
  answer_seven: 'Good question! Rosie, our robot, identifies suspicions, that is, strange behaviors. This is done by using algorithms, an automatic work. She observes spending that does not follow a pattern, such as a very high expenditure on food, something that seems suspicious. But not everything Rosie finds is necessarily irregular. For whom a suspicious expense is considered irregular, it takes a human research work. Irregular is what, in some way, is written in the standard: overpriced expenses, food payments to third parties and other things you have seen here.'
  question_eight: 8. Why do not you talk about political parties?
  answer_eight: Have you noticed that parliamentarians change parties with some frequency? Therefore, we avoid indexes and organization of the data made from the parties of our congresspeople. In addition, our main goal is information, not witch-hunt, hate speech and polarization between right and left.
  question_nine: 9. How can I get in touch to ask a questions, make compliments or share suggestions?
  answer_nine: 'You can contact us through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/operacaoSerenataDeAmor/" target="_blank"> Facebook page </a> or by <a href = "mailto: contact @ serenata.ai "target =" _ blank "> email </a>. If you are from the technical area, you can talk to us <a href="https://github.com/datasciencebr/" target="_blank"> direct by GitHub </a>, too.'
  question_ten: 10. What is the technical communication channel of the project?
  answer_ten: We're currently using English, in a <a href="https://telegram.me/joinchat/AKDWc0BDOqriD1n-mntRBg" target="_blank">Telegram open group</a>. You are very welcome to join him.
  question_eleven: 11. Why is the technical communication held in English?
  answer_eleven: We have a community created around the project that goes beyond Brazil – that is to say people from other countries interested in contributing. Within the Github repository and the Telegram group we chose to use the English language so we can include the views of these people in the discussion. In addition, several people from other countries have shown interest in our code since day zero. By keeping the code and all technical documentation in English we make it easy for our effort to be used in other countries of the world.
  question_twelve: 12. What is Jarbas?
  answer_twelve: <a href="https://github.com/datasciencebr/rosie" target="_blank"> Rosie </a> is our Robot that has been programmed to identify suspicious uses of public funding, starting with CEAP. It analyse each of the reimbursements requested by our congresspeople, telling us what are the reasons that make each one suspicious.
  question_thirteen: 13. What is Rosie?
  answer_thirteen: A <a href="https://github.com/datasciencebr/rosie" target="_blank">Rosie</a> é a nossa Robô que foi programada para identificar usos ilegais da verba pública, começando pela CEAP. Ela julga cada um dos reembolsos solicitados pelos nossos deputados, nos dizendo quais são os motivos que fazem cada um poderem ser ilegais.
  question_fourteen: 14. Where is Rosie?
  answer_fourteen: 'Rosie is a program(software) that we call a robot because it performs its work in an autonomous and preprogrammed way. In other words, someone programmed Rosie and "put her to work". The rest does it alone: it takes the available data, analyzes, applies algorithms (hypotheses) and identifies suspicions. Because it is a program it can be installed by anyone who has an intermediate knowledge of programming, but does not have a face or looks like any humanoid we see in movies.'
  question_fifteen: 15. How can I contribute to the project?
  answer_fifteen: You can contribute to the project with code, helping to maintain the team, with ideas,  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23serenatadeamor" target="_blank">retweets</a> and shares. To understand how to get started with our code base, <a href="https://datasciencebr.com/how-does-one-contribute-to-serenata-de-amor-operation-36e3e7b38207#.een62m7or" target="_blank">check this post</a>. To  directly contribute to the maintenance of the project you can tip us at <a href="https://apoia.se/serenata" target="_blank">apoia.se</a>.
  question_sixteen: 16. Do you act in municipal ways?
  answer_sixteen: 'Unfortunately, we have not started to act in smaller areas yet, due to technical limitations: we do not have a team to scale the work and there is no standardization of data in the municipal spheres. This means that we would have to make requests for the law of access to information and study the structure of the data in each of the municipalities supervised.'
  question_seventeen: 17. an I use the source code of Serenata de Amor in my city, state or country?
  answer_seventeen: Sure, this idea is awesome — and also this idea is one of the main purposes of our adoption of open source.
