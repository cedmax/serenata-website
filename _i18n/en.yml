  title: Serenata de amor operation.
  who_contributed: People who contributed
  paragraph_one: We are a project who make use of artificial intelligence to audit public accounts and fight corruption. The idea came from the data scientist
  paragraph_two:  when he realized about the many possibilities to use technology to inspect congressperson’s spends. When he shared the idea with friends, the project growth in strength in no time and the team was formed with the goal to finish the project.
  paragraph_three: Serenata de amor Operation was born, focused on inspection of reimbursements made by Quota to the Exercise of Parliamentary Activity, who pays for alimentation, transport, lodging and even culture, courses and TV signatures of federal deputies.
  paragraph_four: On September 7 goes live the first crowdfunding campaign of the project, asking for money to pay for the team work for 2 months. In the end, the campaign raised 20% more than the original asked value, summing up more than U$25.000,00.
  paragraph_five: 'We officially started the job in the beginning of november and it was marked, since then, by team daily meetings and for it’s fully open source content, that means, open for the community. This makes part of our guidance: more than a technology project, our goal it is to spread information and political conscience. We want to settle a new age of open data and it’s public access.'

  answer_one: 'We are a <a href="https://twitter.com/cuducos/status/819520770716090368" target="_blank">group</a> of technology enthusiasts. The project, which started as <a href="https://datasciencebr.com" target="_blank">Data Science Brigade''s</a> initiative, CODELAND''s data science division, has grown and today has taken a life of its own, with many professionals from outside the company. All the code is open sourced, we have a body of hundreds of volunteers: employees from all over the world, including journalists and researchers.'
  question_two: 2. Where are you?

  answer_nine: We have a community created around the project that goes beyond Brazil - people from other countries interested in contributing. Within the Github repository and on our Telegram channel, we chose to use the English language so we can include the opinions of these people in the discussion. In addition, several people from other countries have shown interest in our code since day zero. Keeping the code and all technical documentation in English, we make it easy for our effort to be used in other countries of the world.
